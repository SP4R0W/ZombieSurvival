# Zombie Survival
A simple project for getting used to Godot 4

### About
-------------
This project was made for me to get a bit friendly with Godot 4. I also made it to help get my friend, Dipshtick (Varga) on board with Godot. <br>
The game itself is nothing special, it's an infinite wave shooter, but the game's code can be easily expanded upon to add more features. <br>
Current features are:
<ul>
  <li>Basic UI that keeps updating itself</li>
  <li>Infinite wave mechanic</li>
  <li>Player movement and shooting/li>
  <li>Two different weapons and Zombie "AI"</li>
</ul>
Being a project made to teach means there are way more comments that I'd normally put in, but maybe someone will need those so I left them in. <br>
Please note this game is not shared on any websites. If somehow you'd find it somewhere, it's probably a fake. You can build the game yourself from Godot or play in editor.<br>

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need regular Godot 4. Do not forget you will need the required export templates. <br> 
More in-depth guide is avaiable here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.
